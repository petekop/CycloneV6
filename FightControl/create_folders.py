"""Utility for creating CAMSERVER video capture folders.

This module provides :func:`create_fight_structure` which prepares the
directory tree used by the CAMSERVER capture system. The folder tree is
only for storing captured video files. Round-level CSV logs such as
``coach_notes.csv`` are stored in the fighter data directories created via
``create_fighter_round_folders``.
